# Mobile Web Ergonomic Fixes

## The Fixes

### 1. Hover state stuck after tap

Touch has no hover, so browsers fake one: the first tap on an element applies `:hover` and leaves it there until the user taps somewhere else. A button that scales up on hover stays scaled up after being tapped. Gate every hover style behind a capability query.

```css
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .button:hover {
    background: var(--gray-3);
    transform: scale(1.02);
  }
}
```

Both conditions matter. `(hover: hover)` means the primary input can hover. `(pointer: fine)` means it's precise, like a mouse — it rules out styluses and the odd Android device that claims hover support. In Tailwind v4 the `hover:` variant already compiles to `@media (hover: hover)`; in v3 set `future.hoverOnlyWhenSupported`.

Touch users still need press feedback. Give it to them through `:active` (see §5), which works on every input type.

### 2. Gray/blue flash on tap

iOS Safari and Android Chrome paint a translucent highlight over any tapped element that has a click handler. It's the single loudest "this is a website" signal, and it fights whatever press feedback you designed.

```css
html {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

Set it once, globally. Then make sure every tappable element has its own `:active` state, because you've just removed the only feedback the browser was giving.

### 3. Layout has the wrong height

`100vh` on mobile is the *largest* viewport — the height with the browser chrome collapsed. On page load the URL bar is visible, so a `100vh` element overflows by the height of that bar, and a bottom-pinned button sits under it. Use the dynamic and small units instead:

```css
/* App shell, drawers, anything that should track the visible area as chrome shows/hides */
.app { height: 100dvh; }

/* Heroes and first screens — the smallest the viewport gets, so nothing is ever cut off */
.hero { min-height: 100svh; }
```

`dvh` resizes as the URL bar collapses, which is right for an app shell but causes layout shifts on marketing content mid-scroll. `svh` is stable and never overflows, which is right for a hero. `lvh` is the old `vh` — you almost never want it. Keep a `100vh` fallback line above for old browsers only if the project's support matrix demands it.

### 4. Page zooms into the input

iOS Safari zooms the page when focus lands on an input whose font size is under 16px, and it does not zoom back out on blur. The user is left looking at a cropped, drifted layout. This is the reason people reach for `maximum-scale=1`, which is the wrong fix (Hard Rule 4).

```css
input, textarea, select {
  font-size: 16px; /* the minimum; 1rem at the default root size */
}
```

If the design calls for smaller text in inputs on desktop, scale it up only where it matters:

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  input, textarea, select { font-size: 16px; }
}
```

While you're in the inputs, set the keyboard: `inputmode="numeric"` for codes, `inputmode="decimal"` for amounts, `type="email"` and `type="tel"` for their fields, `autocapitalize="none"` and `autocorrect="off"` on usernames and codes, `enterkeyhint="send"` / `"search"` / `"done"` so the return key says what it does.

### 5. Tap feels laggy

Two separate causes stack here.

**The 300ms click delay.** Browsers wait after a tap to see whether a second tap is coming, because double-tap zooms. Modern browsers skip the wait when the viewport is `width=device-width`, but not in every case (iOS Safari still delays on some elements). `touch-action: manipulation` tells the browser this element never double-tap-zooms, so it fires `click` immediately:

```css
button, a, [role="button"], .tappable {
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
```

**Feedback on release instead of press.** Native buttons respond the instant your finger lands. A web button that only changes on `click` responds when your finger *leaves*, which reads as lag even at 0ms. Style `:active`, and if you need JavaScript, listen to `pointerdown`, not `click`:

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 100ms var(--ease-out), background 100ms;
}
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  background: var(--gray-4);
}
```

Keep press feedback at 100–160ms and `ease-out`. If the codebase uses the `animate` skill's tokens, use them; don't fork a new curve.

### 6. Pull-to-refresh hijacks scroll

Scrolling past the top of the page triggers pull-to-refresh on Android Chrome and the whole-page rubber band on iOS. Fine on a document. Wrong in an app with its own scroll containers, a drawer the user drags down, or a canvas.

```css
html, body {
  overscroll-behavior: none;
}
```

Then, on any inner scrollable — a sheet's content, a chat list, a sidebar — stop scroll from chaining to the page when it hits the end:

```css
.sheet-content {
  overflow-y: auto;
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
```

`contain` keeps the container's own bounce (which feels native) but stops the page behind it from moving. Use `none` on the root, `contain` on children. Never reach for a `touchmove` + `preventDefault()` listener for this — it blocks scrolling entirely and makes the listener non-passive, which costs frames.

### 7. Content stops at the notch

By default the browser letterboxes your page inside the safe area, leaving the notch, Dynamic Island, and home-indicator zones the body's background color. A native app paints edge to edge and pads its *content* away from those zones. Two steps:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover" />
```

```css
.app-header {
  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
}
.bottom-bar {
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}
.sheet {
  padding-bottom: calc(1rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom));
}
```

`viewport-fit=cover` lets the page under the notch; `env(safe-area-inset-*)` gives you the insets to pad back out. Without the meta tag the `env()` values are all `0px`. Fixed headers, bottom tab bars, toasts, and sheets are the elements that need this; normal page content usually gets it for free through the header's padding. Give `env()` a fallback (`env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)`) when the value is used in a calc.

### 8. Long-press selects button text

Hold a finger on a web button and iOS selects its label, or pops the copy/share callout on a link. Native controls never do that. Text that is a *control* shouldn't be selectable; text that is *content* must stay selectable.

```css
button, [role="button"], .tab, .chip, .drag-handle {
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;   /* Safari still needs the prefix */
  -webkit-touch-callout: none; /* no long-press callout on links/images used as controls */
}
```

Never put `user-select: none` on `body`. Users copy addresses, error messages, and order numbers; that is content.

### 9. Carousel scrolls vertically

A horizontal swipe on a carousel is ambiguous to the browser — it doesn't know whether you're scrolling the page or the track, so it guesses, and the guess is often the page jittering up while the carousel moves. Tell it which axes the element owns:

```css
.carousel {
  touch-action: pan-y; /* the carousel handles horizontal; the browser keeps vertical */
}
.drag-surface {
  touch-action: none;  /* a custom gesture (a drag-to-dismiss sheet, a slider) owns every axis */
}
.vertical-sheet-handle {
  touch-action: pan-x; /* the sheet handles vertical drags; horizontal stays with the browser */
}
```

The values name what the *browser* may still do. `pan-y` on a horizontal carousel means "browser, you keep vertical panning; I'm handling horizontal". `none` means the element handles everything — use it only on elements that really do, or the user won't be able to scroll past them.

If the carousel is native scroll rather than a JS gesture, prefer `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` on the track and `scroll-snap-align: start` on slides — the browser's own physics beat a hand-rolled spring, and `touch-action` becomes unnecessary.

### 10. Status bar color doesn't match

The status bar and the browser chrome take their color from `theme-color`. One value means light mode gets a dark bar or dark mode gets a white one. Give each scheme its own:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff" />
<meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#0a0a0a" />
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />
```

Match the value to the color at the very top of your page — the header background, not the brand color. In Next.js set it through the `viewport` export (`themeColor: [{ media, color }]`). If the app switches theme with a class rather than the OS setting, update the tag from JavaScript on toggle. For an installed PWA, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` and the manifest's `theme_color`/`background_color` are the same decision.

### 11. Right in Chrome, wrong on phone

Nothing above reproduces in device emulation. Sticky hover, the tap highlight, the URL bar's effect on `vh`, input zoom, the click delay, overscroll, safe areas, the software keyboard — every one is a real-hardware behavior.

- Connect the phone over USB, run the dev server on `0.0.0.0`, open it by the machine's LAN IP.
- iOS: Safari → Develop → the device. Android: `chrome://inspect`.
- Test on a phone that's a few years old, not the newest one on your desk. Test with the keyboard open. Test in landscape once.
- Test as an installed PWA if that's a target; standalone mode changes viewport, safe areas, and status bar behavior.

The Xcode Simulator is a step up from emulation but still misses touch feel. Real hardware is the bar.
